    <h1>Builder Phase - Creating programs and solving problems</h1>
            <p>This phase is a comprehensive deep dive into core programming concepts, designed to empower learners with both foundational and practical skills.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Control Structures & Loops:</strong></li>
                <p>Students explore how decisions and repetitions shape program flow, mastering nested loops and control statements like break, continue, and pass. Real-world examples and infinite loop scenarios help solidify understanding.</p>
                <li><strong>Functions & Scope</strong></li>
                <p>Learners build reusable code blocks with functions, grasp variable scope, and experiment with default and keyword arguments. Recursion introduces elegant problem-solving techniques, while best practices ensure clean, maintainable code.</p>
                <li><strong>Input/Output & File Handling</strong></li>
                <p>From capturing user input to formatting output and reading/writing files, this section connects code to real-world data, preparing students for practical applications.</p>
                <li><strong>Data Structures</strong></li>
                <p>Students work with lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets—learning how to store, access, and manipulate data efficiently.</p>
                <li><strong>Error Handling</strong></li>
                <p>Understanding exceptions and using <strong>try</strong>, <strong>except</strong>, <strong>else</strong>, and <strong>finally</strong> teaches resilience in coding. Raising custom exceptions and debugging practices foster confidence in troubleshooting.</p>
                <li><strong>Working with Libraries</strong></li>
                <p>Exploring built-in libraries like math and random, students learn to extend Python’s capabilities and even create their own modules.</p>
                <li><strong>Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)</strong></li>
                <p>This section introduces classes, objects, constructors, inheritance, and polymorphism—laying the groundwork for structured, scalable software design.</p>
                <li><strong> Review & Final Project</strong></li>
                <p>A recap ties everything together, and students apply their knowledge in a creative final project, showcasing their skills and problem-solving abilities.</p>
